I'm Relebohile Precious Phoba, a dedicated and passionate educator with a Degree in Integrated Organisational Communications and a TEFL 120-Hour Certification. I'm currently pursuing my PGCE to further enhance my teaching skills.

*About Me:*

When I'm not teaching, you can find me on the golf course, expressing my creativity through art, or getting lost in a good novel. I'm a strong believer in lifelong learning and strive to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for my students.
